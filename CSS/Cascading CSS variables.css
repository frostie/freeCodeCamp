/* When you create a variable, it becomes available for you to use inside the element in which you create it. 
It also becomes available within any elements nested within it. This effect is known as cascading.
Because of cascading, CSS variables are often defined in the :root element. By creating your variables 
in :root, they will be available throughout the whole web page. */
